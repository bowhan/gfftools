## Tools to manipulate GTF/GFF formats
Mostly uses [gpertea's excellent gclib library](https://github.com/gpertea/gclib).

### To compile

```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && make install
```

### modules

1. RNA_length<br>
_output lengths of each mRNA with its mRNA and gene name_

#### usage
```bash
```

2. convert from gtf/gff to refFlat<br>
_refFlat is mostly used by piccard to calculate RNA coverage_
#### usage
```bash
```
